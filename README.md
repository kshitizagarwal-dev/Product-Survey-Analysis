# Product-Survey-Analysis
This is the Product Servey Analysis, in which I conduct a survey through the google form, where people can tell in which city and state they are and what would they like to purchase.
The whole idea behind this project is to understand that whether a particular geographical condition has an impact on the purchasing of the product.
The dataset contains:- A. Timestamp B. Your Age, C. Gender, D.City you reside in, E.Product(s) you like/wish to purchase, F. Do you like to visit to parties more frequently?
It has 210 enteries(or rows).
